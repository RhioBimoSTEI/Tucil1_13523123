4. Make a loading/indication that the file is being processed (if the DEBUG is not on)
6. Add Back button and when error/no solution, go back to MainPanel
7. Do Custom Solving
8. Add Stop Button on Debug or while solving
9. Visualize the board (future is also for custom solving)
(Optional) : Do Pyramid Solving
#. Further Testing
