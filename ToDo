This is My To-Do List:
1. Fix the damn Solver or Something
    - Print How the puzzle is solving but don't print "Puzzle Solved!" Every-time a puzzle is being placed
    - Only give warning about expected puzzle pieces when all the pieces is already placed/scanned(?)
    - Make the Puzzle Piece's letter correspond with each letters of the pieces
2. Color Code the Output (if not GUI yet)
